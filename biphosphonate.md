### Protocol and Registration
This systematic review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al, 2009). The review was recorded under the Prospero registry (registration number 42014013516).

### Eligibility criteria
Diretrizes de práticas clínicas  multidisciplinares apoiados por uma organização não governamental ou fornecidas nacionalmente relacionada ao uso de bisfosfonatos e odontologia serão incluídos. Para garantir que as guidelines mais atuais serão incluídas: diretrizes com data limitada a janeiro de 2008 em diante foram incluídas na revisão. 

### Information sources
We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Lilacs, BVS.
- Manual search: Google Website
- Através do site OECD, pesquisei os países membros (http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm) para então procurar suas "dental associations", as quais encontrei através destes dois sites (http://www.toothfriendly.ch/for-dentists/dental-associations/) e (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dental_organizations#D).
- Foi enviado email a todos ou autores das guidelines incluídas no estudo 
- In addition, we searched the references of the included articles manually, as well as we performed a citation analysis of the included studies using google scholar



### Search
- PubMed: ((bisphosphonates AND osteonecrosis AND jaw AND guidelines)) OR (("Osteonecrosis/chemically induced"[MAJR] ("Osteonecrosis/diagnosis"[MAJR] OR "Osteonecrosis/diagnosis"[MeSH Terms]) "Diphosphonates/adverse effects"[MAJR] "Humans"[MeSH Terms]))  
- Manual Search: Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaws Recommendation oral health 
Osteonecrosis associated with Bisphosphonate

### Study selection
- Titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently evaluated by 3 reviewers (FC, JC and APBF). Abstracts which did not provide enough information regarding the eligibility criteria were kept for full-text evaluation. The same reviewers then independently evaluated full-text articles and determined study eligibility. Disagreements were solved by consensus and if disagreement persisted, they sought a third reviewer’s opinion (R.P).

1. Aim 1 - Conduct a systematic review of Clinical Practice Guidelines targeting crack and cocaine: Standard systematic searching methods as proposed by the [PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)]() standard will be used in the search and data aggregation, the quality of each Clinical Practice Guideline being evaluated through the recommendations of a recent systematic review.
2. Aim 2 - Develop clinical case exercises and corresponding infographics in an online course for healthcare professionals: Based on the results of the systematic review resulting from Aim 1, we will compile a series of "facts" from the Clinical Practice Guidelines, graded according to the strength of their evidence. These facts will then be used to populate a series of clinical case models using a standard Automatic Item Geration framework as previously described in the psychometric literature. Finally, these facts will be transformed into infographics summarizing the information from the systematic review

Quality evaluation: I will make use of a 2013 systematic review that has compiled recommendation on best practices for the evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines. Their recommendations include factors such as the ones displayed under Table 1.
Table 1 - Siering's quality dimensions (  Siering et al., 2013) 

Construct	Elements
1. Information retrieval	Health questions and outcomes, Literature search, Literature selection
2. Evaluation of evidence	Grading of evidence, Consistency between evidence and recommendations
3. Consideration of different perspectives	Norms and values, Expert knowledge, Patient perspectives
4. Formulation of recommendations	Formulation of recommendations
5. Transferability	Comparability, Costs, Barriers and facilitators
6. Presentation of guideline content	Benefits and harms, Link to evidence
7. Alternatives	Options for management, Exceptions, Patient preferences
8. Reliability	Independent Review, pilot test
9. Scope	Rationale and objective, Guideline topic, Practice setting, Patient population,  Provider population, 
10. Independence	Guideline development group, Guideline development organization and funding, Conflicts of interest
Fact extraction, aggregation and reporting: Each one of the facts across all Clinical Practice Guidelines and their respective quality evaluation will be extracted and reported through a table containing the original citations, criteria taken into consideration when assigning the quality grade and the fact itself.
