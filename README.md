1. Aim 1 - Conduct a systematic review of Clinical Practice Guidelines targeting crack and cocaine: Standard systematic searching methods as proposed by the [PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)]() standard will be used in the search and data aggregation, the quality of each Clinical Practice Guideline being evaluated through the recommendations of a recent systematic review.
2. Aim 2 - Develop clinical case exercises and corresponding infographics in an online course for healthcare professionals: Based on the results of the systematic review resulting from Aim 1, we will compile a series of "facts" from the Clinical Practice Guidelines, graded according to the strength of their evidence. These facts will then be used to populate a series of clinical case models using a standard Automatic Item Geration framework as previously described in the psychometric literature. Finally, these facts will be transformed into infographics summarizing the information from the systematic review

Quality evaluation: I will make use of a 2013 systematic review that has compiled recommendation on best practices for the evaluation of Clinical Practice Guidelines. Their recommendations include factors such as the ones displayed under Table 1.
Table 1 - Siering's quality dimensions (  Siering et al., 2013)
